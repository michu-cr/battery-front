          An automotive battery, or car battery, is a rechargeable battery that
          is used to start a motor vehicle. Its main purpose is to provide an
          electric current <br /> to the electric-powered starting motor, which
          in turn starts the chemically-powered internal combustion engine that
          actually propels the vehicle. Once the engine is running, power for
          the car's electrical systems <br /> is still supplied by the battery,
          with the alternator charging the battery as demands increase or
          decrease
